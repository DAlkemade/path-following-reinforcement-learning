# Project L310
## Project description
Use reinforcement learning to learn a controller for a robot to follow a path. You can use OpenAI Gym and OpenAI baseline packages. As a first step, design the path following environment, where the robot con control forwards and rotational velocities in order to follow a path. Discuss the reward function, observation space and hyper-parameters of your RL
method of choice. Extensions: Implement a second environment where the robot does not directly learn velocities, but instead, learns the hyper-parameters of a feedback-linearized lowlevel path-following controller. Analyze how these hyper-parameters change as a function of observations, and compare to the original end-to-end solution.
